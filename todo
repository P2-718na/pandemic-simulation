-covid simulation:
    -map with heatpoints
    -restaurants, schools, workplaces (each with different parameters)
    -(maybe) means of transport
    -curfew

-Get a sample database of a population
-Each home will house a family
-Run simulation based on family (different workplaces, schools etc.)
-see result

will need to implement:
    -map import algorithm
    -pathfinding algorithm (maybe using means of transport as well)
    -find a suitable database
    -find covid-related spread data


    (maybe only relevant data is rt-index? This could lead to a way simpler project:
        -random cells, people move, each infected person has rt-index percentage of infecting someone else. rt
        will need to be either a derivative or be found. This could be way easier.

first things to do:
    -develop simpler version with random pathfinding and heatmap (something simple, maybe add weighted paths to simulate
    means of transportation):
        -image reading
        -pathfinding system
    -go next
