-covid simulation:
    -curfew/lockdown

- Check seeder, general cleanup

will need to implement:
  -pathfinding algorithm (maybe not. Even a simpler "follow roads if possible" solution would be nice).

General todos:
    - change cast to c++ style cast (maybe, maybe not)
    - Add HUD to show day, infected, susceptible etc
    - Write README
    - Add different commands (toggle lockdown, maybe edit config on the go etc...)
    - Use lyra to parse initial arguments
    - Rewrite main to make it tidier

- general cleanup of the code.
- check cmake includes and linking

- on linux lags hard every 4th day. Maybe worth checking
- valgrind memcheck smart pointers AI stuff
