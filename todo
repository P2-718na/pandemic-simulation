will need to implement:
  -pathfinding algorithm (maybe not. Even a simpler "follow roads if possible" solution would be nice).

General todos:
    - change cast to c++ style cast (maybe, maybe not)
    - Write README

- general cleanup of the code.
- check cmake includes and linking

- on linux lags hard every 4th day. Maybe worth checking
- valgrind memcheck smart pointers AI stuff
